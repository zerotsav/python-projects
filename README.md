# Mini Python Projects Collection

Here are the Python projects that I have created and will continue to create. This repository will serve as a place to upload all the mini Python projects I build over time.

The projects are simple, beginner-friendly, and designed to help practice programming basics while having fun. I will keep updating this repo as I create more projects throughout the year.

Feel free to explore the code, try the projects yourself, and suggest improvements if you want!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
